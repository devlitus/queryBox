# bunfig.toml — Bun runtime configuration for queryBox
#
# IMPORTANT: `bun test` invokes Bun's native test runner, NOT Vitest.
# This project uses Vitest for testing. Always use:
#
#   bun run test           — run all tests once
#   bun run test:watch     — run tests in watch mode
#   bun run test:coverage  — run tests with coverage report
#
# Do NOT use `bun test` directly — it bypasses package.json scripts and
# runs Bun's built-in runner, which will fail because our tests require
# Vitest's globals, happy-dom environment, and vitest.config.ts setup.

[install]
# Use exact versions to ensure reproducible installs
